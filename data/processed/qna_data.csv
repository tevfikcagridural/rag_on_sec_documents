What are the major factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin in the most recent 10-Q compared to the previous quarters?,"In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include:

1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.
2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin.
3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin.

"In what ways have Microsoft's inventory levels shifted during these quarters, and what does this suggest about their management of the supply chain?","During the quarters presented, Microsoft's inventory levels have shown fluctuations:

- In Q3 2022, the inventory was $3,742 million (2022 Q3 MSFT.pdf).

"Has there been a considerable shift in NVIDIA's operating costs over the reported quarters? If so, what are the main causes for this shift?","Yes, there has been a considerable shift in NVIDIA's operating costs over the reported quarters. The main causes for this shift include:

1. Acquisition Termination Cost: In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion due to the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. This one-time cost significantly impacted operating expenses for that period.
